## Overview
This repository hosts the dataset and accompanying resources for the paper titled "[Training a Text-to-Speech System for Dialectal Arabic with a Focus on the Iraqi Dialect](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11170567)". The dataset is intended to aid researchers and developers in the field of speech synthesis, specifically focusing on Arabic dialects.

## Tools for the Iraqi Dialect TTS Corpus

**1. Arabic Phonetiser**  
A customized phonetic transcription tool that supports the unique phonemes in the Iraqi dialect.
