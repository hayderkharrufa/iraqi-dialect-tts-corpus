# Resources Folder

This folder includes:

1. **Pre-Trained Model:** A foundational model you can further refine.
2. **Synthesized Samples:** Example speech synthesized using the pre-trained model.

You can see an example training repository here: [TTS Arabic PyTorch](https://github.com/nipponjo/tts-arabic-pytorch.git).

Feel free to contribute by improving the model or adding new data!
